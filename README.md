Implementing a "Particle filter on Episode (PFoE)"
====

### Python module for implementing a PFoE.   
[PFoE algorithm was proposed by Ueda et al. in 2016](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-48036-7_54) to let robots learn episodic tasks.   

## Usage  
```PFoE.py``` is the body of this module.  
Likelihood function is defined in ```likelihood_function.py``` then please edit this.  
I showed concrete usage in ```example.py```. please refer to.
